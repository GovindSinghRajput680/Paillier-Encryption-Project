# Paillier Encryption Project

This project implements the **Paillier Cryptosystem**, a probabilistic asymmetric encryption algorithm, using modular arithmetic in C++. It was developed as part of an academic project under the guidance of **Professor Arpita Korwar**.

## 📌 Project Structure

- `sender.cpp`: Handles user input and initiates the encryption process.
- `encryption.cpp`: Performs encryption using the Paillier cryptosystem.
- `decryption.cpp`: Decrypts ciphertext using the private key.
- `receiver.cpp`: Simulates message reception and decryption.
- `common.h`: Contains shared constants, data structures, and function declarations.
- `Makefile`: Automates compilation of the complete project.

## 🔐 Paillier Cryptosystem Overview

The Paillier cryptosystem is based on the decisional composite residuosity assumption and supports **homomorphic addition**, making it suitable for privacy-preserving computations such as secure voting, private data aggregation, etc.

### Key Features:
- Public-key encryption
- Additive homomorphism:  
  If \( E(m_1) \) and \( E(m_2) \) are ciphertexts, then  
  \( E(m_1) \cdot E(m_2) \mod n^2 = E(m_1 + m_2) \)

▶️ How to use

To build the project, ensure you have `g++` and `make` installed. Then run:
```
  make
 ./program
 Enter your message

```
